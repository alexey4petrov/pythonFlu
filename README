Introduction
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Python OpenFOAM binding that allows interactivelly use OpenFOAM 
(Open Source CFD Toolbox, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/foam/ )
API into Python (see http://www.python.org/ ). 
The main goals of development of Python OpenFOAM binding are 
 - to provide more convinient way to extend / customize OpenFOAM functionality
   (as for analysts as for method developers);
 - support interaction with third-party libraries & utilities into a transparent 
   and non-intruisive way;
 - perform all calculations and data processing interactively and in memory
   (not through files).

Installation
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the INSTALL file for more information about building of "pyFoam" package.

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to use "pyFoam"
  - Use predefined set of solvers in the same way as referenced OpenFOAM ones
    ( ${PYFOAM_ROOT_DIR}/Foam/applications/solvers/incompressible/icoFoam.py, for example )
  - Write your own solver ( or modify existing one ) through usage of corresponding 
    Python OpenFOAM API
    (see, ${PYFOAM_ROOT_DIR}/Foam/applications/solvers/incompressible/icoFoam.py, for example )
