Introduction
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pythonFlu is a Python front-end to the OpenFOAM (Open Source CFD Toolbox). pythonFlu
intends to define a new level of flexibility and user interaction scenario for
numerical simulation software; it brings innovative ideas to break the
long-standing wall between the solver developers and the end-users. 

  - If you are a careful analyst, you will be able easily understand what your
    solver is doing and why. 

  - If you are an experienced guy, it will provide you the full control over
    the solver execution - you will be able to 

    * couple different solvers you have, 

    * write customization subroutines, 

    * define your benchmarking and pre/post processing procedures. 

  - If you are a solver developer, you will clearly understand why users need
    all this features; users will be able to adopt your code to their needs
    even without you! 

  - If you are thoughtful project manager, you will appreciate this software
    because it increases team productivity by 

    * alignment of the user experience communication; solver developers and
      end-users will speak in the same terms and in the same language 

    * ability to formalize and automate most of the analyst tasks as well, as
      quickly be adopted to new non-standard demands 

    * improving quality of the calculations, because through this software
      your team will obtain not just solver engines, but the general way to
      standardize your routines 

    * applying the best software for every subtask you do; pythonFlu will be able
      glue them all into one application / environment.


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unique pythonFlu calculation capabiltities 
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Pure interactive behavior 

    * run solver as in "step by step", as in "all at once" mode 

    * direct access to the all solver data during its execution 

    * ability to couple different solvers into a new calculation scheme 

    * batch mode benchmarking and optimization (users need not to use
      scripting, they already have Python) 

  - Full customization control 

    * ability to modify or extend solver code without additional compilation
      step 

    * easy to introduce entry points for to customize solver behavior 

  - Non-intrusive gluing with different technologies, libraries and
    applications 

    * seamless integration with SALOME application 

    * data post-processing through VTK and Qwt 

    * can use Qtlibrary as a GUI front-end 

    * can use CORBA for remote access / communication 

  - Keeps the same performance as the referenced OpenFOAM C++ code

Why Python 
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Python is mostly used in scientific and engineering programming 

  - Python code is easy to read, understand and learn to program 

  - Python support all the modern programming features 

  - Python code is typically 5-10 times shorter than equivalent C++ code 

  - Python programmer can finish in two months what two C++ programmers can't
    complete in a year 

  - Python comes with a vast collection of libraries (as standard, as
    third-party) 

  - Object Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, virtual functions e.t.c) 

  - Operators customization (user can write your own definition for '+' or
    '-') 

  - Exception based error handling


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why OpenFOAM 
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In principle, the technology pythonFlu uses (SWIG) to deliver its functionality,
can be applied to any library and solver framework. At the same time pythonFlu
choose OpenFOAM as its source by the following reasons: 

  - OpenFOAM uses advanced, robust and proven numerical simulation engine 

  - OpenFoam allows the user to use syntax that closely resemble the partial
    differential equations being solved. For example: 

      solve( fvm.ddt( rho, U ) + fvm.div( phi, U ) - fvm.laplacian( mu, U ) 
             ==
             - fvc.grad( p ) )

  - It comes with a growing collection of pre-written solvers applicable to a
    wide range of problems 

  - First and most capable general purpose CFD package to be released under an
    open-source license 


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the INSTALL file for more information about building of "pythonFlu" package.


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two main ways to use "pythonFlu", namely:

  - Use existing pythonFlu based solvers in the same way as referenced OpenFOAM ones
    ( See http://pythonflu.wikidot.com/install-solvers for more details )

  - Write your own solver ( or modify existing one ) through usage of corresponding 
    Python OpenFOAM API
