New Features and Important Changes, r7.4 vs r7.3

Author(s) :  Alexey PETROV

2010-04-04

1. Adjusting to the "common configuration system" (confFoam package)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"confFoam" is a "common configuration package" for the realted OpenFOAM (Open
Source CFD Toolbox, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/foam/ ) developement. 
The neccessity for defintion of such kind of functionality appears from the
issue that OpenFOAM referece build system does not provide corresponding
capabilities. As result of lack of the configuration capabilties OpenFOAM
users/developers strugle with compilation procidure trying to discover reasons
for this or that failure.

"confFoam" proposed implementation based on standard Linux/UNIX "GNU automake"
tools. This set of tools allow users adjust the environment they are going to
use for compilation of sources and check, wheter everything is correct, before
starting actual compilation. As result, users become aware of the all
prerequisites needed to compile the given sources and directly informed if
something is wrong.

2. Restoring the support for "singlelib" disabled compilation
-------------------------------------------------------------
"singlelib" mode of compilation allows dramaticaly reduce the compilation time 
(up to 10 times, for now) by combining all the avaialble pyFoam SWIG packages 
into single library. This feature is especially important when users are trying 
to advance the pyFoam, by wrapping missed OpenFOAM functionality or extending 
existing OpenFOAM API with features they like.

At the same time this feature is disabled by default to keep modularisation 
capabilties of the current pyFoam implementation. It means, that each package 
should have the same dependencies as the referenced OpenFOAM once. So, users 
will be able to load and use only functionality they need.

New Features and Important Changes, r7.3 vs r5.0

1. Support for definition of the derived Python classes
-------------------------------------------------------
pyFoam users can define derived classes from corresponding C++ ones. This 
feature is extremely usefull when users are trying to define their own
implementation of "fvPathFields". This also means, that pyFoam could be used as
a fullgrown developement platform for the OpenFOAM developement.

2. Support for "constructor to table" OpenFOAM feature
-------------------------------------------------------
OpenFOAM implementation defines its own "plugin" system, also known as 
"constructor to table" feture; when derived functionality can be instateated 
and be used by its name. Now it is possible as to write your own derived classes
in pure Python, as to register it into corresponding OpenFOAM "factory". This 
also means, that pyFoam could be used as a fullgrown developement platform for 
the OpenFOAM developement.

New Features and Important Changes, r5.0 vs r4.0

1. Porting to the OpenFOAM-1.6
-------------------------------
This version of OpenFOAM swigging can produce Python wrapping for every 
official OpenFOAM version since 1.4.1. The most important thing that this 
wrapping support the same Python API for every OpenFOAM version. So, 
the Python user code need not to be modified to follow the pure C++ OpenFOAM
modifications.

2. Reducing / precising binary dependecies
-------------------------------
Since this version, every sub package can introduce its own third-party 
dependecies. As an example it is possible to check the following packages:
  - src (which used customized version of "include.makefile" -
  "src.include.makefile")

  - Foam/application/utilities/postProcessing/graphics (which is responsible
  for foam2vtk wrapping; introduces VTK dependencies)

  - /Foam/applications/utilities/mesh/conversion/ (which is responsible for
  unv2foam wrapping; introduces VTK dependencies) 

As an implicit result, "Foam.OpenFOAM" Python module now dependes only from
corresponding C++ OpenFOAM library, as well as "Foam.finiteVolume" Python
module dependes from C++ finiteVolume one and so on.


2. Wrapping of the new third-party package - unv2foam
-------------------------------
The "unv2foam" - package is based on the existing since OpenFOAM-1.5 -
"ideasUnvToFoam" command line utility. Been repackaged it provide the ability
to create corresponding Foam::fvMesh in memory.

The packaging for the Python related utilities was adjustied with
corresponding OpenFOAM/application/utilities.

New Features and Important Changes, r4.0 vs r2.0

1. Providing OpenFOAM related packaging
-------------------------------
This version generates its SWIG libraries into the same OpenFOAM does. For
example, it provides "OpenFOAM" and "fintiteVolume" Python libraries which
include all related functionality. These libraries can be accessed through the
special Python module - "Foam", which simulates the C++ "Foam" namespace. The
same things are done for "fvc" and "fvm" namespaces, which are represented by
different libraries. So, user can explicitly control what functionality he is
going to use, minimize dependencies and clarify its Python code.


2. Wrapping of the third-party packages (foam2vtk)
-------------------------------
Since this version, pyFoam will include wrapping of C++ functionality which
as extends the existing OpenFOAM API as introduce a completely new
functionality.

"foam2vtk" Python package will provide the ability to map the foam field data
to the native VTK data structures in memory (which can be easily displayed after). It is
based on the existing OpenFOAM's vtkFoam package.

3. Moving complex test cases to special package - IFoam
-------------------------------
IFoam - is defined as a separate software package which will be responsible
for "hybrid scripting"; it will provide a design solution for intergration of
different application and technologies (like SALOME, OpenFOAM and Star-CDF++)
for defintion of an integrated user environment for calculation and solver developing.

1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly explains some of the most important changes made
since the release of pyfoam-r1.0. The goal is to provide information for
people who want to upgrade an older pyfoam interface to the new version.

2. 'Hybrid scripting' capabilities
-------------------------------
The contains examples how to orginze interaction with SALOME from within 
Python code.

3. Post-processing capabilities
-------------------------------
The contains example how to publish intetmediate solver results to 
SALOME VISU module.
