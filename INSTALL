Pre-requisites
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"pythonFlu" Python OpenFOAM binding requires the following mandatory and optional
pre-requisites.

* Make sure that confFlu (common configuration package) is installed 
  Can be found at  http://sourceforge.net/projects/pythonflu/files.
  Please follow instructions from corresponding INSTALL file to setup confFlu
  in your environment.

* Make sure that OpenFOAM is installed (tested with 1.4.1-dev, 1.5, 1.6, 1.6-ext, 
  1.7.0 and 1.7.1 versions). Please follow instructions from corresponding INSTALL file 
  to setup OpenFOAM in your environment.

* Make sure that Python (developement version, with Python.h header file) is 
  installed (tested with 2.4, 2.6.2)
  Please follow instructions from http://www.python.org/ web-site.

* Make sure that SWIG is installed (tested with 1.3.36 - 1.3.40)
  Please follow instructions from http://www.swig.org/ web-site.

Then follow the instructions below in order to build and install the "pythonFlu".


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Installation
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The build procedure of the "pythonFlu" package is based on GNU autoconf and make utilities. 
In order to build the module you have to perform the following actions:

1. Start a new shell session (to ensure a clear environment).

2. Go to the source directory:

   cd <path to the sources>

3. Modify the provided "env.sh" file to adjust to your local environment.
   
   <your favorite editor> ./env.sh

4. Source this "env.sh" file to define the corresponding build environment.

   source ./env.sh

5. Configuring the build system:

   ./build_configure
   ./configure

   Make sure that after each configuration step the "--- OK ---" message is
   printed in your console.

   To see all applicable configuration options run "./configure --help"
   Currently, the following options are available:

      --with-swig=<path>
      --with-python-includes=<path>
      --with-python-libraries=<path>

6. Source the generated on configure step "bashrc" file to define the corresponding 
   build environment.

   source ./bashrc

7. Build and install "pythonFlu":

   make
   make install

  (use "make clean" command to cleanup the build folder)


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before using pythonFlu do not forget to configure OpenFOAM itself

   # For OpenCFD's OpenFOAM-1.7.1
   source /opt/openfoam171/etc/bashrc 

   # For Extended's OpenFOAM-1.6
   source /usr/lib/OpenFOAM-1.6-ext/etc/bashrc


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation check
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Import installed pythonFlu kernel library

  python -c "from Foam import finiteVolume"

Note : Install one of the existing pythonFlu based solvers to verify this installation 
on a more complex test case. See http://pythonflu.wikidot.com/install-solvers for more 
details
