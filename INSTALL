Then follow below instructions in order to build and install the "pyFoam" - Python 
OpenFOAM binding.


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Installation
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The build procedure of the "pyFoam" package is based on GNU autoconf and make utilities. 
In order to build the module you have to perform the following actions:

1. Go to the source directory:

   cd <path to the sources>

2. Modify and source the provided "env.sh" & "bashrc" files to adjust to your 
   local environment.

3. Configuring the "pyFoam" build system:

   build_configure
   ./configure

   Make sure that this step was passed succesfully.

   Currently, the following options are available
      --disable-singlelib
      --enable-embeddedcxx
      --with-swig=<path>
      --with-python-includes=<path>
      --with-python-libraries=<path>
      --with-extfoam=<path>
      --with-vtk-includes=<path>
      --with-vtk-libraries=<path>
      --with-foam2vtk=<path>
      --with-unv2foam=<path>
      --with-boost-includes=<path>
      --with-boost-libraries=<path>

  To see more details for the applicable options run ./configure --help.

4. Build "pyFoam":

   make


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"pyFoam" installation check
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following "pyFoam" solver
  ./Foam/applications/solvers/incompressible/icoFoam.py 
on the appropriate OpenFOAM case 
( use the same command line option as for referenced OpenFOAM implementation )
